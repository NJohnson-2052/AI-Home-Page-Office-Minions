            <p> AI is a concept that has been around for almost as long as computers. The first digital computer was made in the 1940's, and Alan Turing came up with the idea of the Turing Test in the 1950's, as a way of telling how "human" a computer program is. How has AI changed in the years since then? </p>

            <h3>While genAI is the most famous form of AI being developed, there are other kinds of AI in use.</h3>
            <p class="block1"> Video games have been using AI for their non-playable characters (NPCs) since the 1980s, with the emergence of games like Pacman. These characters are not controlled by real people, but they use pathfinding and finite state machines to control where they walk and change their behavior, respectively. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="block2"> Programmers are now trying to create more advanced AI with human-like emotions and personalities, as opposed to responses to their environment based on code. Some developers are also trying to incorporate genAI into their games. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="block3"> AI is also being used in a variety of industries, such as healthcare. These AI aren't generating new content, but rather detecting patterns or helping find new solutions. Companies like Johnson and Johnson can use AI to detect cancer years before current methods, use robots to assist in complex surgery, or find new treatments for diseases. </p>
